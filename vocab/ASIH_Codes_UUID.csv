The collection has continued to grow in size, scope, and importance since its founding. The collection is taxonomically diverse, but its especially strong among eels, characiforms and catfish. Its geographic scope is world-wide, but it's strengths include freshwater species of North and South America and marine species of the Bahamas, Western Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Continued growth results from recent expeditions to the Bahamas, South America and Asia."

The collection includes a few freshwater fishes, mostly from rivers and streams in the Hawaiian Islands and elsewhere in Oceania. The collection is fully digitized, with complete and annotated records for all specimens entered in the database, and many of the film images scanned. The fish collection represents the bulk of the lifetime work of Dr. John E. Randall, Senior Ichthyologist (now Emeritus), who began working in the collection in 1965 and a half-century later continues to publish on fish systematics and biogeography. Dr. Richard L. Pyle continues to add to the collection, with an emphasis on collecting specimens from deep coral-reef ecosystems (so-called Mesophotic Coral Ecosystems, or the Coral-Reef Twilight Zone), using advanced diving technology."

Much of the material is in large geographic series, and many sites have been sampled repeatedly through extended periods of time. Some specimens are from the original New York State Biological Survey (1926-39).

Seth E. Meek (1897-1914) pioneered the study of Neotropical freshwater fishes. Loren P. Woods (1941-1978) amassed large and important collections of freshwater fishes from North America and marine fishes from the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans. Robert K. Johnson (1972-1986) obtained significant collections of mesopelagic fishes and shorefishes from Belize and Honduras amounting to more than 100,000 specimens. Donald J. Stewart (1978-1985), Barry Chernoff (1987-2002), and later Assistant Collection Manager Phil Willink (2002-2010) rejuvenated our early Neotropical freshwater research and collection emphasis by conducting numerous expeditions to Ecuador, Peru, Surinam, and Venezuela. Since his arrival, Mark Westneat (1991-2013) expanded the marine collections, focusing on Indo-Pacific coral reef fishes. Leo Smith (2007-2013) strengthened the midwater and deep-sea collections from both sides of the north Pacific Ocean. Caleb McMahan (2014-present) works on growth of the Neotropical collections."
